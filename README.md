# Sentiment_analysesFromTweeter

Using the the packages "rtweet" and "syuzhet" as main packages i will make a sentiment analyse. 

I downloaded the Gustavo Petro's timeline using a Twitter API key, then i proceed to clean the database and using the "syuzhet" package i proceed to make a sentiment analyse to understand how the Colombian president candidate talks in his official Twitter account. 

If you want to use the same code, you are free to use it, i explain each part of the code in my comments, just take in consideration the date when you download the information from Twitter which is not the same than mine:(2022-05-25). 

Cheers, hope you like the code and find it useful.

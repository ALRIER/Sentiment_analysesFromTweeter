# Sentiment_analysesFromTweeter

Using the the packages "rtweet" and "syuzhet" as main packages i will make a sentiment analyse. 

I downloaded the Gustavo Petro's timeline using a Tweeter API key, then i proceed to clean the database and using the "syuzhet" package i proceed to make a sentiment analyse to understand how the Colombian president candidate talks in his official tweeter account.
